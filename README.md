# Synchronous scrolling in Angular

- This project demonstrates logic for creating a reusable directive for shared scrolling between multiple scrollbars

- The project consists of two directives:

1. `appNativeScrollSync`: Directive can be used to synchronously scroll native scrollbars

2. `appIscrollSync`: Directive can be used to synchronously scroll multiple iscrolls

## TODO

- Right now only horizontal synchronous scrolling is supported. Need to add logic for vertical scrolling
